    "In this assignment, you are asked to produce analysis that follows a set of instructions. You can do this any way you like, as long as you show me your results and the code you used to get there. The easier this is for me to replicate, and the clearer the code is, the higher your mark will be. One option would be to make a copy of this file, add in code snippets, and submit the RMarkdown file along with the PDF of completed results. Another option would be to send me a link to an .ipynb notebook file on Github. \n"

Not that class selectors won't work, because the class attribute is called \"klasse\". You can use normal attribute selectors.\n",
