Wenn man den Vorschlägen der Union vom 9. März gefolgt wäre, lieber Herr Merz, nämlich Nord Stream 1 abzustellen, dann hätten wir heute eine Gasmangellage. Weil man den Vorschlägen der Union in Bezug auf die Abhängigkeit von Russland über 16 Jahre gefolgt ist, haben wir heute diese massive Krise, die Sie mitzuverantworten haben. Das muss an den Anfang der Rede gestellt werden; denn wenn Sie, Herr Güntzler, sich hierhinstellen und sagen: „Die Probleme sind verursacht durch die Ampel“, dann kann ich nur lachen. Wir haben einen russischen Angriffskrieg in der Ukraine, wir haben eine Energiekrise, auch ausgelöst durch die massiven fossilen Abhängigkeiten, die Sie über Jahrzehnte geschaffen haben, und wir haben jetzt – der Finanzminister hat es ja gesagt – einen Energiekrieg, der geführt wird von Russland gegen die Europäische Union. Deswegen brauchen wir jetzt einen Abwehrschirm. Und deswegen ist es richtig, dass wir zum vierten Mal in diesem Jahr entlasten – mit einem Entlastungspaket von 200 Milliarden Euro. Zur Ausgestaltung. Zu fordern, das müsse jetzt alles fertig vorliegen: Ich meine, wir müssen natürlich auch beachten, dass wir uns jetzt auf europäischer Ebene bei der Gaspreisbremse und der Strompreisbremse abstimmen. Wir können hier doch nicht rein national vorgehen. Wir müssen uns abstimmen. Es geht darum, dass wir auf der einen Seite die Kosten senken; die Preise müsse runter, ja. Aber damit wir nicht erneut in eine Gasmangellage kommen, müssen wir auf der anderen Seite eben auch Energie einsparen. Deswegen ist es bei der Ausgestaltung des Gaspreisdeckels ja auch so wichtig, abzuwägen, welche Kontingente wir an die Verbraucher/-innen, an die Unternehmen geben und welcher Sparanreiz auch bestehen bleiben muss. Auch das ist wichtig und ökonomisch verantwortungsvoll. Und zu sagen, wir hätten nicht gehandelt: Wir haben in Rekordzeit vier Anlandungspunkte für LNG-Terminals geschaffen, die diesen Winter an den Markt kommen werden. Wir haben in Rekordzeit vier Entlastungspakete – das letzte mit 95 Milliarden Euro – für die Bürgerinnen und Bürger und jetzt auch für die Unternehmen auf den Weg gebracht, um die Preissteigerungen abzufedern. Wir haben in Rekordzeit im Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, aber auch in den anderen Ministerien zum Teil über die Schmerzgrenze hinaus gearbeitet, um diese Maßnahmen auf den Weg zu bringen. Diese Regierung hat gestern noch mal eindrücklich bewiesen, wie schlagkräftig, wie verantwortungsvoll und auch wie handlungsfähig wir sind. Ich bin stolz darauf, dass wir das als Ampel gestern auf den Weg gebracht haben. Es geht jetzt auch darum, dranzubleiben. Nichtsdestotrotz ist keine Zeit für Entwarnung. Das war jetzt ein wichtiger Schritt. Der Winter wird hart, und wir müssen den Menschen auch sagen: Es wird Belastungen geben. Wir helfen denjenigen, die sie alleine nicht tragen können. Aber es werden auch Belastungen in Kauf genommen werden müssen in einer solchen Krise. Die Wirtschaftsdaten deuten auf eine Rezession in den nächsten Monaten hin. Wir tun alles, um das abzuwenden, um konkret zu helfen. Und da wünsche ich mir mehr konstruktive Opposition von der Union. Viele Dinge tragen Sie mit. Aber bitte schüren Sie nicht zusätzlich Angst in der Bevölkerung. Die Bevölkerung braucht jetzt Stabilität. Wir als Ampel schaffen Stabilität. Vielen Dank.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Using regular expressions\n","\n","Using a regular expression, get a list of words spoken in your parliamentary protocol that contain (in upper or lower case) the string \"kohle\" (coal).
